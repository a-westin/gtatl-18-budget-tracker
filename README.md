# Budget Tracker

## Description  

  This project showcases a node.js application that acts as an online/offline budget tracker. Users are able to keep track of expenses while online or offline; any transactions made while offline will be stored in the 'pending' collection, then will become visible in the database once the user comes back online. Transactions are stored in MongoDB and the app has been deployed to [Heroku](https://afw-budget-tracker.herokuapp.com/) using MongoDB Atlas.
